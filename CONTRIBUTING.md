# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Everything in this repository is under the MIT
licence (see `LICENSE`), and every contribution is accepted under the same
terms: what comes in is licensed exactly as what goes out. There is no
contributor licence agreement to sign.

## Sign your commits

Every commit needs a Developer Certificate of Origin sign-off
(https://developercertificate.org, version 1.1): `git commit -s` adds the
`Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` line. The sign-off says you
wrote the change, or have the right to submit it, under MIT. Pull requests
with unsigned commits are not merged.

## Before you open a pull request

- Open an issue first for anything bigger than a small fix, so the shape is
  agreed before the work.
- One issue per pull request, and keep it small. A pull request that is
  readable in one pass gets merged; one that mixes concerns gets bounced
  with a `too-big` label.
- Add or update tests for the behaviour you change.
- Run the gate locally and paste its output into the pull request:
  `npm run gate` (typecheck, build, lint, tests).
- Do not bump the version. Leave `manifest.json`, `package.json` and
  `versions.json` alone, and do not edit `CHANGELOG.md`: we bump the version
  and write the changelog at release, on our own cadence. A pull request
  that bumps the version is bounced.
- No new runtime dependency without an issue that agrees to it first.
- Say so in the description if the change touches credentials, a network
  host, a spawned process, a workflow file or a dependency. Those get a
  security read before the review.

## How a change ships

Contributors do not push to `main`; every outside change arrives as a pull
request. Merging a pull request ships nothing: releases are cut from a
version tag by the maintainer, never from a push to `main`, so your change
reaches members with the next tagged release.

## Forks and new projects

The Obsidian directory encourages developers to collaborate on fewer
high-quality projects, so a change that fits this plugin belongs here as a
pull request.

The Obsidian Community directory does not list forks: its Developer policies
state that "Forks are not allowed in the Community directory unless" the fork
"has received explicit written approval from the original author in a
publicly verifiable way" or the original author has been unreachable with no
update for at least 6 months, and that "If your project diverges from
existing options, it should not be a fork. Start fresh with a new repository
and your own code." So a project that diverges from this plugin ships under
its own plugin id and its own name, never `icor-for-life-terminal` or
"ICOR for Life - Terminal": the id is unique to this entry and its Owner, the
name is covered by `TRADEMARK.md`, and the MIT licence grants you the code,
not the listing and not the name.

## Security

For a security problem, use the process in `SECURITY.md` instead of a public
issue or pull request.
